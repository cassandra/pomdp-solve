    Make sure we do not have a tableaux where there are more slacks in
    the basis than we expect.  When there is degeneracy in the problem,
    it might be the case that not all of the x_i and/or y are actually
    in the basis.  Mattheiss says that the optimal tableaux is
    guaranteed to have all the x_i and y, but I think what he really
    meant was that there exists an optimal tableaux with such a
    property.  With degenerate problems, there could be more than 1
    optimal tableaux, so we need to ensure that we pick an optimal
    tableaux that has this property.

    We check to see which slacks are in the basis.  If there are too
    many then that means that there must be some x_i and/or y that are
    not in the basis.  We decide which slacks we will kick out of the
    basis, by the RHS of the row they are basic in (or their current
    solution value).  If the RHS is zero, then they will have zero
    value whether or not they are in the basis.  Furthermore the zero
    RHS will not change the values of any variables, since the addition
    or subtraction of this row to reformulate the tableaux will leave
    the RHS values in tact.  Therefore we can pivot in the omitted x_i
    or y in the row with the slack variable's RHS value is zero, and
    get an equivalent objective value but now with the x_i or y in the
    basis.  Note that whether in or out of the basis, these particular
    x_i that enter or the slacks that leave will have zero value.  

    Note that this only needs to be done when adding getting the basis 
    for the first tableaux.  All other tableaux's are specifically set by 
    this program and will thus have exactly the property we are trying 
    to verify with this routine.

    There is a sticky precision thing which makes this routine a little 
    more complex than it should be.  We will kick out basics that are 
    essentially zero, but we also need to kick them out in value order
    from least to greatest until we have reduced the number of slacks
    to the appropriate amount.  This is required as illustrated by 
    the following example:

    Let's say we only need to get rid of one slack and we have (in order)
    these two slack variable values:

    slack_vals[5] = -4.9294179453189837e-16
    slack_vals[14] = -4.163336342344337e-17

    The first one is essentially zero, but if we kick this one out then
    the RHS of the slack basic's row will become a large number, since
    they are relatively close in value.  This can cause the tableaux that 
    would result with the new basis to be infeasible, which we would rather
    not have.
