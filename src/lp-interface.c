 *   Module that defines the LP interface functions needed by the
 *   pomdp-solve program. It will either call the appropriate CPLEX or
 *   lp_solve library function depending upon the compilation
 *   configuration. 
 * 
 *   Actually using an LP after it is allocated is a matter of first
 *   creating and allocating the LP data structure, then setting all the
 *   constraints and objective rows, solving or optimizing the problem
 *   and then finally, retrieving the solution results.
 * 
 *   Thus the general scheme for an LP for a POMDP with 'm' states and an
 *   LP with 'm' constraints goes something like:
 * 
 *    LP lp;                       # Pointer to LP data structure. 
 *    lp = LP_newLP( m, n );       # Only need to call this once.
 *    result = LP_solveLP( lp );   # Solve LP and get solution.
 *    LP_freeLP( lp )              # Only need to call this at very end.
 * 
 *   Note that internall the LP_optimizeLP() routine does this general
 *   scheme to solve the LP instance: 
 *  
 *   LP_loadLP( lp );         # Tell solver to set things up.
 *   LP_optimizeLP( lp );     # Let the solver solve the LP.
 *   LP_getSolution( lp );    # Get the solution information.
 *   LP_unloadLP( lp );       # Tell solver you are done with LP.
 * 
 *   The main LP data structure have the variables that would be directly
 *   used by CPLEX.  Even if CPLEX is not being used, we will use the
 *   CPLEX structures to create and LP instance, but only when it comes
 *   time to solve the LP will it be converted into the proper format for
 *   the particular solver.  This concentrates all the LP dependency in a
 *   single spot and just requires writing a translator from the
 *   CPLEX-style LP to the LP solver available.  For non-CPLEX solving
 *   you alos need to write a translator that will extract the solution
 *   information into the CPLEX-like data structure.

/* 
   There are a lot of little pain-in-the-neck indexing problems that
   need to be worked out when converting CPLEX structures to lp_solve.
   Here is the basis of all this math assuming a full dense
   coefficient matrix. Because the LP_loadLpSolveLP() actually copies
   the CPLEX sparsity, the computation is a little easier.  However,
   this is useful reference material.

     --------------
     LP_SOLVE MATH: 
     --------------

     Assuming the '1'-based indexing that lp_solve uses, and the
     storage of the objective row in the coefficient matrix, here is
     the calculation for the index into the 'mat' array for new value
     'coef' at position (row,col):

     mat[lp->rows * (col-1) + row].value = coef;

     If we were given the (row,col) in zero-based numbering, then we
     would have:

     mat[lp->rows * col + row + 1].value = coef;

     Going the other way around, computing the row and col for
     matval[i] is:

     row = i % lp->rows;
     col = (int) (i/(lp->rows) + 1);
     coef[row][col] = mat[i].value;

     -----------
     CPLEX MATH: 
     -----------

     Assuming the zero-based indexing and *no* objective row in the
     coefficint matrix here is the the calculation for the index into
     'matval' for new value 'coef' at position (row,col):

     matval[ lp->rows * col + row] = coef;

     Going the other way around, computing the row and col for
     matval[i] is:

     row = i % lp->rows;
     col = (int) (i/(lp->rows));
     coef[row][col] = matval[i];

     -------------------
     LP CONVERSION MATH:
     -------------------

     We now consider how to map the coeffiecient matrix of CPLEX to
     that of lp_solve.  Assuming we are looping over all indices of
     'matval' with index 'i' being under consideration, we have the
     zero-based:

     zero_row = i % lp->rows;
     zero_col = (int) (i/(lp->rows));

     but lp_solve is '1'-based indexing, so we really need:

     row = i % lp->rows + 1;
     col = (int) (i/(lp->rows)) + 1;
     
     Since row '0' of CPLEX constraints is row '1' of lp_solve. Now we
     know (from above) that to set ('1'-based) (row,col) element in
     the lp_solve matrix we need:

     mat[lp->rows * (col-1) + row],value = coef;
     
     So a strict replacement yields:

     mat[lp->rows * (((int) (i/(lp->rows)) + 1)-1) 
         + (i % lp->rows + 1)],value = coef;

     which happens to be equivalent to:

     mat[ i + i/lp->rows + 1],value = coef;

     which makes sense because each entry is just offset with the
     amount depending upon which column it is in, since this
     defines how many objective coefficients have preceeded it.  

     Since the objective coefficients are stored separately in CPLEX
     and they correspond to row '0' in lp_solve, objective coef 'i'
     (zero-based) goes into the matrix at position:

     mat[ i * (lp->rows+1) ].value = obj[i];

       The weirdest part is that this index is actually to the first
       element of the *next* column. Yuck. Anyway, this is complicated
       even more by the '1'-based indexing of lp_solve.  This leaves
       me completely unclear as to what value col_end[0] should have
       or even if it matters. I've assumed it is zero, but you never
       know. This is set right after thes loops.

       However, right now 'lpi' points to the first entry in the next
       column, which is exactly what lp_solve needs 'col_end' set to
       for this column.  Also, notice the adjustment of the 'col'
       variable to compensate for the '1'-based indexing of
       lp_solve. */

     constraints, so if you want >= you must multiply the constraint
     by -1 if you want to use it.  Judging from the set_const_type()
     routine in lpkit.c, it seems that equality constraints are
     obtained by setting the upper bound on the constraint to zero.
     
     Although the set_const_type() routine will actually do what
     we want it to do, assuming that all the coefficients and RHS
     values have been already set, we prefer to adjust >= row to <= by
     ourselves as was done above.  However, we do still need to set
