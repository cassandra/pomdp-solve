Notes on adding command line/config file options.

Edit the pomdp-solve-options.xml (or pomdp-tools-options.xml) file, by
adding whatever you want.  Follow the syntax.

In the 'src' directory, execute:

  ./scripts/enerate-options/gen-program-opts.py pomdp-solve-options.xml

This will geenrate the files pomdp-solve-options.[ch].

naturally, you should not hand-edit these files as any changes will be
lost on rerunning this command.
