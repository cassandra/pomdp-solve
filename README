ChangeLog: Changes to the code since version 4.0

ToDo: My personal list of things I would like to do with the code, but
      haven't gotten around to.  

./src:  The main source directory for the pomdp-solve program.

./doc: This directory has some useful documentation such as file
        formats, command line arguments, etc.  Start with the
        index.html file to see the various documents.

./mdp: This directory contains the code for a library of low-level
       POMDP manipulation routines, including parsing files and the
       internal representation used by the program.  Only look at the
       stuff in this directory if you want to muck around with the
       file format and/or the internal representation.

./lp_solve: This directory contains the code for a public domain
            linear programming solver. It is included it in this
            distribution because some minor changes were needed to
            integrate it with the pomdp-solve code.  If the commerical
            program CPLEX does not exist, this is what is used to
            solve the linear programs required.

./test: This directory has some test cases used by the auto-test
        executable. It contains some POMDP files as well as some
        finite and infinite horizon value functions and policy
        graphs.
